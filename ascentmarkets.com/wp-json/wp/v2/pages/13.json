Such extension is subject to a Renewal Fee (Rolling Fee) at the rate and time as specified on the site. The Company via the AscentMarkets trading platform shall collect such Renewal Fee from the free balance in your account held with AscentMarkets . In the event there are not sufficient funds in your free balance to cover such fee(s), you hereby agree that AscentMarkets may charge, at its sole discretion, such fee(s) from your credit card(s). Please note that the minimum charge from a credit card is EURO 3.00. Accordingly, any surplus balance, after paying the Renewal Fee(s) will be credited to your balance. If AscentMarkets is unable to collect such fee(s), AscentMarkets reserves the right to close part, or all, of your open positions. You shall be liable for promptly paying all Renewal Fees fee(s), even if all margins previously\ndeposited by you have been lost.\u00a0The result of the above is that even a slight fluctuation of the market could mean substantial gains\u00a0when these fluctuations are in your favour, but that could also mean considerable losses if the\u00a0fluctuations are to your detriment. No system exists that could assure you that transactions on the\u00a0foreign currency market should bring you great benefits, nor is it possible to guarantee, that your\u00a0transactions will yield favourable results. The amount you could lose in a transaction carrying limited\u00a0risk will never be more appreciable than that which you can lose in transactions having no\u00a0pre-determined limit on loss. Nevertheless, even though the extent of the losses could be subjected to\u00a0an agreed-upon limit, the risk of incurring losses could be higher, and that loss could occur in a\u00a0relatively short period of time. It is possible that some unfavourable situations on the market could\u00a0occur, in a relatively short period of time, resulting in the\ntotal loss of your investment. Since deposit of an additional guarantee is not obligatory in this case, AscentMarkets reserves the right to close the outstanding balances without the customer\u2019s consent. The risk information presented here does not reflect all of the risks as well as other important aspects intrinsic to the stock market. Therefore, before starting to trade, you should learn the specifics of trading on stock markets in detail. You should conclude an Agreement for opening and\/or closing transactions on the market only if you are absolutely sure of the size of its possible risk and consequences and if you understand in detail the scope and range of your rights and obligations.
