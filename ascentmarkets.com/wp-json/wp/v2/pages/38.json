Conditions where conflicts of interest can occur include the following:<\/p><ul><li>The Company or a relevant person, or a person directly or indirectly linked by control to the Company, is likely to make a financial gain or avoid a financial loss, at the expense of the client.<\/li><li>The Company or a relevant person, or a person directly or indirectly linked by control to the Company, has an interest in the outcome of a service provided to the client, or of the transaction carried out on behalf of the client, which is distinct from the client\u2019s interest in that outcome.<\/li><li>The Company or a relevant person, or a person directly or indirectly linked by control to the Company, has a financial or other incentive to favour the interest of another client or group of clients over the interests of the client.<\/li><li>The Company or a relevant person, or a person directly or indirectly linked by control to the Company, carries on the same business as the client.<\/li><li>The Company or a relevant person, or a person directly or indirectly linked by control to the Company, receives or will receive from a person other than the client an inducement in relation to a service provided to the client, in the form of money, goods or services, other than the standard commission or fee for that service.<\/li><\/ul><p>Relevant person in relation to the Company means any of the following individuals:<\/p><ol><li>a member of the board of directors, partner or equivalent, manager or tied agent of the Company;<\/li><li>a member of the board of directors, partner or equivalent,

natural person who is directly involved in the provision of services to the Company or its linked agent under an outsourcing arrangement for the purpose of the provision by the Company of investment services or\/and the performance of investment activities.<\/li><\/ol><p>The affected Parties if a conflict of interest arises can be the Company, its employees or its clients.\u00a0 More specifically, a conflict of interest may arise, between the following parties:<\/p><ol><li>Between the client and the Company.<\/li><li>Between two clients of the Company.<\/li><li>Between the Company and its employees.<\/li><li>Between a client of the Company and an employee\/manager of the Company.<\/li><li>Between Company\u2019s Departments.<\/li><\/ol><p>Conflicts of interest can occur in several situations, for example:<\/p><ul><li>The Company is likely to sustain an overall financial loss or avoid a financial loss, by executing a client\u2019s specific order.<\/li><li>The Company is likely to sustain an overall financial gain by not executing a client\u2019s specific order.<\/li><li>The market moves to a direction of a point\/timing when by executing the client\u2019s order will result in a financial loss for the Company.<\/li><li>The Company\u2019s hedging policy is affected negatively by the market movement and as a result client\u2019s orders are rejected to prevent a
